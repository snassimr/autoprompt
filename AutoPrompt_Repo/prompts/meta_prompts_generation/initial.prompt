As an advanced language model you should create {num_samples} challenging and unique prompts for the task outlined below.
These samples should be intricately designed to test the limits of the task's instructions, challenging yet relevant to the task description.

The task description and instruction is phrased as a generative task. The results prompts samples should be input to the the model.
The model will be able then to generate an example given the instructions and the prompt input.

### Task Description:
{task_description}

### Task Instructions:
{instruction}

### Requirements for Challenging Samples:
1. Each prompt must present a unique and intricate challenge.
2. The prompts should cover a diverse range of scenarios within the scope of the task, avoiding repetition and predictability.
3. Each prompt should contain only the prompt part, without generating also the results
4. Each prompt should contain only the prompt part, without any mention of the task description or instructions!!
